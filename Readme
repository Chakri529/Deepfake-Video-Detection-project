# Deepfake Video Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect **deepfake videos** by analyzing video frames and identifying fake content using a **deep learning** model. The system combines **ResNet50V2** for feature extraction and **GRU** (Gated Recurrent Units) for temporal sequence modeling, classifying videos as real or fake.

## Features
- Extracts faces from video frames for analysis.
- Uses **ResNet50V2** for powerful image feature extraction.
- Implements a **GRU-based recurrent network** to handle sequential frame data.
- Binary classification: outputs whether a video is **Real** or **Fake**.

## How It Works
1. **Preprocessing**: Video frames are extracted and faces are detected using OpenCV.
2. **Model**: 
   - **ResNet50V2** extracts features from each video frame.
   - **GRU** processes the sequence of features from multiple frames to make a prediction.
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts whether the input video contains deepfake content or is authentic.

### Extra Features
- **Face Detection**: Extracts faces from video frames using OpenCV's Haar cascades.
- **Model Architecture**: Combines **ResNet50V2** for feature extraction and **GRU** for temporal analysis of frames.
- **Binary Classification**: Outputs whether a video is real or fake.
- **Evaluation**: Provides metrics such as accuracy and loss for model performance.
